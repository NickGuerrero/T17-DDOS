# Team 17 - DDOS Experiment
Our objective is to understand what is a DOS/DDOS attack and study solutions for a defense mechanism against the attack. The scope of this project is to replicate a real DOS/DDOS attack and apply a defensive mechanism to prevent that attack. [Here's the full proposal.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1alu3-p0B3g0nGZ8FB6HnVYUlhjNE7wnCEWb89zfn1D4/edit?usp=sharing)
